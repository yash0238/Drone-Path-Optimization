Key Features
1. Intelligent Path Planning: Automatically generates optimal flight paths between source and destination points
2. Battery Optimization: Considers energy consumption as a primary factor in path planning decisions
3. Advanced Obstacle Avoidance: Navigates dynamically around obstacles in 3D space
4. Digital Twin Integration: Creates a virtual simulation of flight paths before execution on physical hardware
5. Real-time Adaptation: Continuously adjusts trajectories based on changing environmental conditions
