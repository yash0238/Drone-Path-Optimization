Drone Path Optimization
This project implements an drone path planning system using Deep Reinforcement Learning to create optimized flight trajectories. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on discrete commands and right-angle movements, this system learns to generate smooth, efficient paths that consider battery consumption, obstacles, and flight dynamics.

Key Features
1. Intelligent Path Planning: Automatically generates optimal flight paths between source and destination points
2. Battery Optimization: Considers energy consumption as a primary factor in path planning decisions
3. Real-time Adaptation: Continuously adjusts trajectories based on changing environmental conditions
